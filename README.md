## Make Change Project

### Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview
In this project, I implemented skills learned from the first week of the SD program to simulate a cash register.

The cash register calculates the amount of change needed to be returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. After amounts entered, it will give the attendant the exact amount of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) to give back to customer. It also lets the attendant know if more money is needed from the customer or exact amount is tendered.
